ADVANTAGE OF
- Inheritance
* Code Reusability
* To implement runtime polymorphism

- Aggregation and Compostion
* Code Reusability

- Object and Class
* Easy maintainance
* To achieve loose coupling

- Method overloading
* Increases the readability of the program

- Method overriding
* Method overriding is used to provide the specific implementation of a method which is already provided by its superclass
* Method overriding is used for runtime polymorphism

- Runtime polymorphism	
* See factory design pattern	

- Static variable	
It makes your program memory efficient (i.e., it saves memory).	

- final variable
