Microsoft 1st round
1- What is run time polymorphism?
Given the example of Os interface and Windows, Linux and Android OS

2- If any palindrome number n is given, what will be the next palindrome number after n
Example: 
Input - 323 
Output - 333 

Interviewer was focused on how you will find palindrome of any number (can be done in O(number of digits in a number) with constant space)

3- Difference between thread and process?
See gate smashers youtube channel video

4- What is kernel level thread and user level thread?
See gate smashers youtube channel video

Microsoft 2nd round
1- Some behavorial questions
If your work is stuck due to some other person in your team, what you will do
Desribe your best project that you worked till now

2- Design Flip Coin Problem
Design so that your program will print head or tail each time when use your API
Note: System should have similiar chances of showing heads and tails (it should be unbaised)

We can use algo to generate random numbers (well distributed hash function)

Extra (Similiar stuff):
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/generate-integer-from-1-to-7-with-equal-probability/
int x=foo();
int y=foo();

if(x==1 && y==1)
	return 1;
else if(x==1 && y==2)
	return 2;
	....
else if(x==2 && y==2)
	return 7;
else 
	again call this function recursively
