CODE:
Node *headNextSegment=null;
int end=1;

Node* reverseAGroup(Node *curr, int k) {
	Node *head=null;
	Node *prev=null;
	for(int i=0;i<k;i++) {
		if(curr) {
			Node *temp=curr->next;
			headNextSegment=curr->next;
			curr->next=prev;
			prev=curr;
			curr=temp;
			head=curr;

		else {
			end=0;
			break;
		}
	}
	return head;

	Node *dummy=new Node(INT_MAX);
	Node *tailPrev=dummy;
	curr=head;
	while(end) {
		Node *tailCurrent=curr;
		Node *headCurrent=reverseAGroup(curr,k);

		tailPrev->next=headCurrent;
		curr=headNextSegment;     //headOfNextSegment

3)
- 2 Dices are given to you
- 1 Dice is Regular (1,2,3,4,5,6) and 2nd dice is empty ('','','','','','')
- Both Dice are thrown at the same time. Let's A number came up on 1st dice and B number came up on 2nd dice
- What 6 numbers we need to put on 2nd dice so that A+B is always in range 1 to 12 and probability of sum of A and B for any number from 1 to 12 is equal.

A + B = [1, 12] with equal probability for each number in this range

Note: A+B should not fall outside the given range for any possibilities

ANSWER is 0,6,0,6,0,6
