- Given a string of lowercase alphabetic characters, find the first unique and first duplicate character.
Expecting a O(n) solution with constant space S(1)
Examples:
String     ->    unique duplicate
“character” ->   h, c
“similarities” -> m, s
"ccccc" ->       null c
"abcd" ->        a null
"ccdddd" ->      null c
"cddddd"  ->     c d

- In above question only, How about sorted characters (if we we sort the string, what will be the answer) 
Expecting a O(n) solution with constant space S(1)
Examples:		
"character" ->  e, a
"similarities" -> a, i
