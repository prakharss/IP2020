1- Implement automated checkin and checkout system. Following are use cases:
a) Assume room can only be booked for 1 day
b) There are only 1 type of room
c) One guest might need multiple rooms for his/her family
d) CheckIn API 
Input: Number of rooms 
Output: List of room number assigned 
e) Checkout API
Input: List of room number
Output: Exception if room is already empty and make filled room empty so other's can occupy these rooms
f) Design should be extensible for other use case in future (if comes)
g) Important usecase to keep in mind
- If a hotel is at hot place (let's say Rajasthan or Jaisalmer), then assign rooms from top to bottom
- If a hotel is at cold place (let's say Goa), then assign rooms from bottom to top
h) You need to write unit test also for checkIn and checkOut functionality.
