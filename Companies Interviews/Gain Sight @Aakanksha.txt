Like singleton and prototype, how many scopes
If we have a HashMap<User, OtherField>, how can we ensure unique Users? hashCode on which field?
Is this valid ? `public final class X { }
public class Y extends X{ }`

or

`public class X { private X(){} }

public class Y extends X{ }`

8. Given three tables :

Employee :: EmpId [PK] | EmpName | EmpDeptId [FK] | EmpDesignationId [FK] | Salary
Department :: DeptId [PK] | DeptName
