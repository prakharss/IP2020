NOTES
* GraphQL Features
- Nothing more and nothing less (no-over fetching and no-under fetching)
- Multiple resources in a single request
- Query Shape === Response Shape

* Rest and graphQL both are stateless as HTTP protocol is stateless

* PATCH method is a request method supported by the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) protocol for making partial changes to an existing resource

* HTTP Status (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes)
- 201 (created), 200 (success), 204 (success but no content)
- 404 (resurce not found), 403 (forbidden), 405 (method not allowed) 
- 500 Internal Server Error
